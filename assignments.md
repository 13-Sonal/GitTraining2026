Each intern will be assigned ONE problem.

Examples:
- Reverse a string
- Fibonacci series
- Palindrome check
- Factorial program

Rules:
- Create branch: feature/<name>/<problem>
- Write code in your own folder
- Raise a PR after completion

- If I write anything in other person's repository's docs and commit it then it will be a wrong commit!
